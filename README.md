## Introduction

This is where my personal website and blog exist, built with a minimalist Jekyll theme called Klis√©, which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
My website is live at <a href="http://bhavya.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bhavya.co</a>

## Installation
To use the theme, run a local server first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavyakh/bhavyakh.github.io.git
cd bhavyakh.github.io
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to `localhost:4000`, and you're ready to go.
